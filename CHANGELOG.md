# Changelog

Each release's section becomes its release notes (see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Newest first.

## 1.0.0

The first release.

- **Remote desktop through your own relay**, end-to-end encrypted: screen,
  mouse and keyboard, the lock screen and UAC prompts included; clipboard
  sync, file transfer and a shell for `dev` shares, each off unless the
  machine's config allows it.
- **Accounts** by invitation, with TOTP and recovery codes, step-up for
  sensitive actions, email verification and security notices.
- **hawk-setup**, one installer for every part: a window on Windows and a
  CLI everywhere. It installs the machine service (with a preflight that
  checks the relay's pinned key before anything is written), the relay on
  a Linux server (systemd, Let's Encrypt with a stable key), and the
  desktop app.
- **Signed updates** for the machine service, the relay and the app, from
  one release feed, with `notify`, `auto` or `off` per install, `stable`
  and `beta` channels, and rollback when a new version doesn't come up.
  Forks follow their own feed and key with nothing to edit.
- **Desktop app** for Windows and Linux (an AppImage, and a `PKGBUILD` for
  Arch): the dashboard in its own window, signing in to any relay
  that allows it (`HAWK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`), several relays remembered.
- Machines show their version, and offer an update in the owner's
  dashboard.
